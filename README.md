To-Do List App
A simple, interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. The tasks are stored in the browser’s localStorage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

Features

Add Tasks: Users can input a task and add it to the list.
Mark as Completed: Clicking on a task marks it as completed (strikethrough).
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by clicking on the "×" icon next to each task.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring they are available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
